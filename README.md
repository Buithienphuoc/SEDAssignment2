Dear Dr.Minh,

Thank you for your support, this is the great excercise to make sure that a developer can learn every basic things of a programming language

I'm currently using Linux OS, it cannot generate .exe file but it is the file without tail "main" I wish I have a teammate who has Windows to test. If the program cannot run, please contact me, I will do whatever you want
Instead of spending 90% time for working, I have to spend 45% to recover my point from assignment 1, I don't want to fail.

You can view my code here, too: https://github.com/Buithienphuoc/SEDAssignment2 

Your sincerely
Phuoc
