Dear Dr.Minh,

Thank you for your support, this is the great excercise to make sure that a developer can learn every basic things of a programming language

I'm currently using Linux OS, it cannot generate .exe file but it is the file without tail "main"
I wish I have a teammate who has Windows to test. If the program cannot rut, please contact me,

Your sincerely
Phuoc
